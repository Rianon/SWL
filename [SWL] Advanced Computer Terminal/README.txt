DESCRIPTION
-----------
Why you probably need this.

When using Computer Terminal (well, devs insists we're "hacking", and I'm not going to make a big rant on how it's not a hacking at all), you expecting to fight with passwords and difficult questions, not the game interface itself. Sadly, that's how the things are in TSW, and SWL was not changed anything. That's why there are always was mods for computer interface in this game. Lack of screen space, arrows for navigation which can be only pressed by mouse click (btw the interface control scheme emulates the classic "keyboard only" terminal), and so on. There is a great mod for TSW called GHOSTTablet, and it's actually work in SWL, but I wanted more, and so I decided to make one myself. Frankly saying, it's my first mod ever. :)
What this mod about.

You got a rather big terminal with "neutral" design. In this game we're using many types of computers, from hi-tech Orochi laptops and tablets to old (that not mean simple/bad) "soviet-style" military monitors, including CRT ones. So I decided not to focus on any specific design and instead of "tablet" or "computer desktop/laptop monitor" I did "a monitor" (with front camera - you know, it's a game about conspirology, "Big Brother watches you", yadda yadda).

I wanted to get rid of that dread arrows (as probably most of you), and it was almost done, but... almost. Not completely. You will not see them anywhere except of some documents in "The Nursery". Do not attempt to click on arrows, they're only signs where you must scroll and in what direction, up or down. Scroll by pressing Up/Down arrows on keyboard or PgUp/PgDown (it scrolls by 1 line of text).

You can input "root", "hint", "help" and "quit" commands with shortcuts, so you don't need to actually type them.

And of course you can apply different skins for the interface! Skins are important. Because they're... well, they are cool, it quite enough. :)

How you can do all this stuff. There are 2 menus, hided by default, one invoked by holding the "Alt" button, and another by holding "Ctrl". So you just hold "Alt"/"Ctrl" and hit the right key. Here the shortcuts list:

    Alt+R : root
    Alt+H : hint
	Alt+L : help
    Alt+Q : quit
    Ctrl+D : Dragon skin
    Ctrl+I : Illuminati skin
    Ctrl+T : Templars skin
    Ctrl+L : Bloody Valentine skin
    Ctrl+S : Standard (green/black) skin

HISTORY
-------
v1.3
* Implement ability to autosave last used skin. Just choose the skin you like, and it always would be used by default.
* Add close button at the top right corner of interface window. Personally I like more hardcore, RP approach, but people wants it too much, so - you want it, you got it. :)
* Add "help" shortcut, use Alt+L. Probably you'll need this only once in all game, but anyway...

v1.2
* Revert default skin to classic green/black and made it choosable again.
* Cleaned interface by adding menu system (you must hold Alt/Ctrl to show menu and then hit corresponding key, similar to Norton Commander).

v1.1
* Added autoskin ability. If the game tells interface to use particular skin, then it use it. If not, the interface search for player faction and applies skin according to that. All seems working now, but need futher testing by members of another factions.

v1.0
* Initial release.
